# CENG450: 16-Bit Pipelined CPU 
![](https://github.com/morganjlw/CENG450/blob/master/cpu.JPG)

## Summary
16-Bit Pipelined CPU design that implements prescribed ISA (see in repos.) written in VHDL. The architecture consists of branching instructions and 16-bit aritmetic including multiplication (with 32-bit resultant handling).Hazard mitigation techniques employed includes operand and store forwarding. I thorough project details each functional unit, control unit, pipeline stage, and hazard mitigation technique, as well as, CPU benchmarking results.
