# VHDL 16-Bit Pipelined CPU 
![](https://github.com/morganjlw/CENG450/blob/master/cpu.JPG)

## Summary
16-Bit Pipelined CPU design that implements prescribed ISA (see in repos.) written in VHDL. The architecture consists of branching instructions and 16-bit aritmetic including multiplication (with 32-bit resultant handling). Hazard mitigation techniques employed includes operand and store forwarding. The included project report details each of the functional units, the control unit, all pipeline stages, hazard mitigation techniques as well as CPU benchmarking results.
